This README provides an overview of the Hate Speech Detection project conducted as part of my university's Machine Learning and Deep Learning course.
The project encompassed three main phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
The primary objective of the project was to develop an automated system capable of detecting hate speech within text data.

Project Phases:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Phase:
In the EDA phase, the HateXplain dataset was extensively explored and analyzed.
The dataset contains a diverse range of text samples, including instances of hate speech.
The main goals of this phase were to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, distribution of classes, and potential challenges.
Exploratory visualizations and statistical analyses were conducted to inform subsequent phases of the project.

2. Machine Learning (ML) Phase:
The ML phase focused on building a hate speech detection model using traditional machine learning techniques.
The dataset was preprocessed, including tasks such as text tokenization, stemming, and cleaning.
Various ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, were trained and evaluated.
The model's performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. Deep Learning (DL) Phase:
The DL phase aimed to enhance hate speech detection using deep learning methodologies.
A neural network architecture, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, was implemented.
The dataset was once again preprocessed to suit the neural network's requirements.
Evaluation metrics similar to the ML phase were employed to measure the DL model's effectiveness.

Dataset:
The HateXplain dataset served as the foundation for this project. It comprises various text samples, with annotations indicating the presence of hate speech. 
The dataset's diversity and the inclusion of explanations for the annotations added complexity to the task of hate speech detection.
